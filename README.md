RandMus
=======

Random Music generator piping into aplay (Linux only)

A simple little program that pipes char data into aplay resulting in random little tunes.
Some sound good and are kind of catchy, a few are extreamly quiet at least at the start, and others blow out your ears and will drive you insane. (could be a good thing I suppose if you like dubstep)

In short, A fun little thing to play around with.

Instructions:

	cd into the RandMus directory
	
	type "make" to compile
	
	type "make run" to run the program
	
	to quit the program type ctrl-c
	
	to view the random values for the current or last song, first open another terminal window, cd to the RandMus directory, and run the command "cat lastSong.txt"
	
	spend hours messing around with it (in a good way)
