RandMus
=======

Random Music generator piping into aplay (Linux only)

A simple little program that pipes char data into aplay resulting in random little tunes.
Some sound good and are kind of catchy, a few are extreamly quiet at least at the start, and others blow out your ears and will drive you insane. (could be a good thing I suppose if you like dubstep)

In short, A fun little thing to play around with.

Instructions:

	cd into the RandMus directory
	
	type "make" to compile and run(play)
	
	type "make clean" to remove the compiled files

	type "make record" to record a random tune
	
	to quit the program type ctrl-c
