RandMus

Random Music generator using aplay (Linux only)

A simple little program that pipes char data into aplay resulting in random little tunes.
Some sound good and are kind of catchy, others blow out your ears and will drive you insane. (could be a good thing I suppose if you like dubstep)

In short, A fun little thing to play around with.
